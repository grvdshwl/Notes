# Lesson 2

## Icons

1.  Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free and paid icons packs
2.  Use only one icon pack. Don’t mix icons from different icon packs
3.  Use SVG icons or icon fonts. Don’t use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png)!
4.  Adjust to website personality! Roundness, weight and filled/outlined depend on typography
5.  Use icons to provide visual assistance to text
6.  Use icons for product feature blocks
7.  Use icons associated with actions, and label them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)
8.  Use icons as bullet points
9.  To keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention,
    use different color
10. Don’t confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or action!
11. Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, enclose them in a shape

## Shadows

1.  You don’t have to use shadows! Only use them if it makes sense for the
    website personality
2.  Use shadows in small doses: don’t add shadows to every element!
3.  Go light on shadows, don’t make them too dark!
4.  Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention)
5.  Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more
6.  Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the interface
7.  Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover)
8.  Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows)

## Border Radius

1.  Use border-radius to increase the playfulness and fun of the design, to
    make it less serious
2.  Typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that border-radius matches that roundness!
3.  Use border-radius on buttons, images, around icons, standout sections and other elements

## White Space

1.  Use tons of whitespace between sections
2.  Use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements
3.  Use whitespace between elements
4.  Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines
5.  The more some elements (or groups of elements) belong together, the closer they should be!
6.  Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much! Then remove whitespace from there
7.  Match other design choices. If you have big text or big icons, you need more whitespace
8.  Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all spacing
