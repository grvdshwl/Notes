# Lesson 3

## Visual Hierarchy

1.  Position important elements closer to the top the page, where they get
    more attention
2.  Use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention (larger images get more attention)
3.  Whitespace creates separation, so use whitespace strategically to emphasize elements
4.  For text elements, use font size, font weight, color, and whitespace to convey importance
5.  What text elements to emphasize? Titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, data points, icons
6.  Emphasize an important component using background color, shadow, or border (or multiple)
7.  Try emphasizing some component A over component B by de- emphasizing component B
8.  What components to emphasize? Testimonials, call-to-action sections, highlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables, etc.

## User Experience

1.  Don’t design complicated layouts. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Use patterns
    that users know
2.  Make your call-to-action the most prominent element, and make the text descriptive
3.  Use blue text and underlined text only for links!
4.  Animations should have a purpose and be fast: between 200 and 500
    milliseconds
5.  In forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical line, to make the form easier to scan
6.  Offer users good feedback for all actions: form errors, form success, etc. [web apps]
7.  Place action buttons where they will create an effect (law of locality) [web apps]
8.  Use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on your main page. Don’t be vague or fancy!
9.  Only include relevant information, efficiently! Cut out fluff and make the content 100% clear
10. Use simple words! Avoid technical jargon and “smart-sounding” words
11. Break up long text with sub-headings, images, block quotes, bullet points,
    etc.
