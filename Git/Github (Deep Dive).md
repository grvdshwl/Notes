## Important Points

Benfits of Organisation account over individual account :-

- **Public Repositories** : They're visible to any user on your GitHub Enterprise instance. **Private Repositories** : They're only available to the repository owner. You can add collaborators of your choise to share with.

- In Individual account we cannot control access level of **outside collaborator** is always provide write access anmd some other higher level access however we can control the access level in organisational account.

- In Organisational account we can choose to add an invidual as a member or outside collaborator.

- In Organisational account we can choose access level of an individual
  collborator on account level i.e. we can choose an access (Read,write) however it will be same for all the Repositories.

- In Teams we have flexible repository access i.e. We can add repositories with more flexible level of access.

- Please note that **orgnisation** level access have priority over **Team** Level access.

- **Forking** is a concept of making copy of the main repository to your account so that you can make modifications in it. You can Submit pull request to the main repository with the modifications. It will make sure that the main repository is prevented from unwanted changes.

- A pull request is an event in Git where a contributor asks a maintainer of a Git repository to review code they want to merge into a project.

## What Is GitHub Issues?

GitHub Issues is a lightweight issue-tracking system that is available in all GitHub repositories. When you create a GitHub repo, you get GitHub Issues out of the box, and more often than not, you keep using it as your project evolves.

In most cases, GitHub Issues is used for reporting bugs and requesting features. Sometimes it hosts discussions, helps process support requests, or even submit documentation feedback.
