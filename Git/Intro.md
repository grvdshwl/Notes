  # Git

## Pros

Git is a open source version control system designed to handle everthing from small to large projects.

Git is all about control and track code changes over time.

Git allows to manage your code history.


## Cons

Code can be managed and accesed  from user's computer and will only be stored in it.


## Git + Cloud = Github


  # Github
  
  It is the largest development platform.
  
  It is cloud hoisting and collaboration provider.
  
  It is Git repository provider.
  
  

## Terminal and shell

  ### Mac
  
  Terminal - Text Input Environment (where we enter the text) - Terminal
  
  Shell - Text Input Interface (complies our text to lower level language) - Bash or Z shell (zsc)
  
  ### Windows 
  
   On Windows there is no clear differnciation b/w terminal and shell.
   
   We have three different options :
   1. Command prompt
   2. Powershell
   3. Gitbash
   

## How Git Works

   Working Directory/Tree - It is folder containg all the files realted to the project and is managed by git.

  Example - Suppose we have three files in a project folder. We will save initial copy/draft of our files with the help of a commit.In later stage we made   changes to a file and commited that change then git only track and store new changes made and will not create a entire copy of our project.And these       changes will be stored in a branch.
  
  .git(Hidden) - Git Repository.
  
  Git has mainly two areas to perform version management action :
  
  1. Staging Area - Index File - all the new changes made to a file and to which file, are stored here to make sure that these changes are stored as       snapshot in next commit.
  2. Commit - Object file - It contains all the snapshots by comparing previous commit with new changes and track those changes only.
  
  
  Git Branches - Suppose we created our entire wesite initially and store all the changes made with multiple commits and deployed it.However later on we need to add a new feature to that website however if we directly make changes to the website it breaks the production code. So we will create a new branch which is an entirely new copy of the branch and will make changes this branch once changes are made and everthing is tested we can merge this branch with our master branch.
