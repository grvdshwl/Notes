# HTML

### HTML stands for hyper text markup language.

> Hypertext refers to a word, phrase or chunk of text that can be linked to another document or text.

> A computer language that consists of easily understood keywords, names, or tags that help format the overall view of a page. Some examples of a markup language are BBC, HTML, SGML, and XML.

### HTML consist of elements that describes different types of content : paragraph,links,heading,images,video etc.

> The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.

> As a Rule of thumb always use only one H1 Tag per page.

### HTML Semantic Elements

> Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
